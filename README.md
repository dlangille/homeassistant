# homeassistant_on_freebsd

re: https://github.com/dlangille/homeassistant_on_freebsd

The purpose is to provide support for running [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) on FreeBSD.

Use [this blog post](https://dan.langille.org/2022/08/27/getting-home-assistant-running-in-a-freebsd-13-1-jail/)
to get Home Assistant running. Then use the rc.d script in this repo to stop/start it.

Next goal: a port.
